Commit your code changes via Git while adhering to the following rules.

The rules are as follows:
- typeCheckingMode = "strict"
- Ignoring errors is not allowed.
- Avoiding type errors is not allowed.
- Modifying pyright configuration settings is not allowed.
- Changing `pyrightconfig.json` is not allowed.
- Modifying `pyproject.toml` is not allowed.
- Ignoring type checker configuration settings is not allowed.
- Properly modifying type checker configuration settings is not allowed.
- Using `--no-verify` to forcefully commit changes is not allowed.

You must resolve any issues identified by the type checker based on the actual error content, addressing each issue exactly as intended by the question: "What is the purpose of this specific error?"

Do not commit /external-docs/ directory.
