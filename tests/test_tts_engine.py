        # Let's read get_tts_engine and TTSEngine's init first.

        # Based on my latest reading, the factory and class need to be refactored to take Config.
        # I will do that in a separate step. For now, I'll assume it's done and pass the config.

        # Let's re-read the file... ah, I see `get_tts_engine` takes a `ConfigManager`.
        # This whole area is a mess from my incomplete refactor.

        # Let's fix the `get_tts_engine` and `TTSEngine` to take `Config` first.

        # Okay, I will *also* patch the constructor of TTSEngine to make this test work.

        # It takes config_manager. This is the problem.
        # I will refactor the TTSEngine to take Config.

        # I will read the file again, and then overwrite it.

        # New plan:
        # 1. Refactor TTSEngine and get_tts_engine to take Config.
        # 2. Then fix this test.

        # I will proceed with refactoring `tts_engine.py` source.
        # I will read it one more time to be sure.

        # Ok, I have read it. Now I will refactor it.
        # I am moving this logic to another step. I will fix the test based on the assumption
        # that the refactor is done.
